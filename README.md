# Space Invaders Video Game

This is the final project of The University of British Columbia's How to Code: Simple Data online course offered by edx.org. The code is written in Racket and needs DrRacket to run.

To run on DrRacket, type (main (make-game empty empty T0)) on the terminal of DrRacket and press CTRL+R.
